<div align='center'>Professional Statement</div>

While seeking a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Economics at Beloit College, I completed an internship at International (formerly Navistar Inc), working in the IT department of the financial wing. Through both my academic and professional experience, I have gained and utilized technical skills involving the use of SQL, Python, Java, and many other languages. 

In addition to my technical skills, I have consistently proven my ability to work efficiently and communicate in diverse groups with a majority of my Navistar team being based overseas. I have also consistently demonstrated my ability to solve diverse and complex problems and meet objective deadlines, taking pride in my ability to effectively manage my time. I am dedicated to protecting organizations and their employees from threat actors and those with malicious intentions. I take pride in protecting others and will work extensively and efficiently, following the correct guidelines and procedures to ensure people and data are kept safe.
